## [The Internet (Abridged)](http://internet-abridged.com/): A Simple, Reactive News Aggregator



### Purpose

This project is a news aggregator loosely targeted towards programming and tech news, with entertainment-related 
subjects mixed in for levity, as nothing but raw news tends to get depressing after a while.



[You can read the excellent gitbook and get a copy of the source I used as a seed here.](https://github.com/ochrons/scalajs-spa-tutorial)

Built using [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/) and [Play](https://www.playframework.com/).


### Scala IDE users

If you are using Scala IDE, you need to set additional settings to get your Eclipse project exported from SBT.

```
set EclipseKeys.skipParents in ThisBuild := false
eclipse
```
